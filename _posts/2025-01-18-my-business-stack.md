I am at a point now having setting up my new business Gamma data to reflect on the structure of my nascent business. 

I have my first client, I have all required HMRC documents, an accountant, business insurance, initial business proposition written down, and the beginnings of my business and finacial processes in place.

Setting up one's own business allows one to think about what kind on business does one want to have, and in this blog to think about what is the business tech stack that will underpin my business.

I have intentionally set out to base my business around Open Source and Linux as far as possible. This is both because of my long standing love for both these things, and because I have noticed in setting up a business the vast number of monthly subscription services that could underpin ones "tech stack", ie. graphic design software, development software, book-keeping software, office software, website hosting, email hosting etc etc. 

These subscription services are admirable in that they allow one to get a business up and running very quickly, but at the same time they all cost money, and it all adds up. I may not know much about business, but I do know two things, sales and margins are the key to a viable business.

To this end, and should it be useful for others below is an outline of my business "tech stack" where I am intentionally building it around Open Source and Linux as much as possible. 

## The stack

### Office productivity
The most important piece of software I use is emacs with org-mode, which serves as my notes, todo and project management, development environment, and almost everything else. Emacs really is the centre-piece of minimising my need to subscribe to many subscription services to get my business up and running.

Standard office productivity software I will use Microsoft Office, simply for interopability with clients. I could use Libre Office, but the ubiquity of Microsoft Office is all powerful.

### Web

#### Hosting
For my web-hosting I have chosen to use carrd.co which allow sone to create simple one-page websites. Because of the simplicity this ends costing £16 a year to host a website with your custom domain. This is less than what it costs per month on many other services. At this point in my business journey. I don't need anything more than a simple website.

#### Blog
I have created my blog using Github pages, which is a free web hosting solution.

### Email
I have continued to use Proton mail, which I have used personally for a number of years for reason of privacy and security. A monthly subscription providing me with a custom domain is less than £5 a month.

### Book-keeping
I am using GnuCash which is a free and open source accountancy package, and while it does look dated, it does more than I will ever need, provides me with all the information I need to send to my accountant, create invoices and manage Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivables, monthly Profit and Loss statements and monitor my cashflow.

### Computer operating systems
The operating system I am using is Linux, Fedora the distribution, I was using Arch Linux previously, but unfortunately I just don't have the time to use the terminal everytime I want to connect a new blue tooth device or change the volume.

I do dual-boot into windows as the Microsoft Office suite is unavoidable when working with clients, I could use it on the web in Linux, but it is easier to just submit to Windows when I need to.

### Backup and cloud storage
My backup and storage solution is that I am running network attached storage on a drive connected to a raspberry pie. I use Syncthing to synch data between my storage and mjy laptop, this is then also synced onto Apple's iCloud to ensure I have data backed up offsite. I also have weekly and monthly backups taking place to mjy onsite and cloud storage. I am not completely happy using Apple for mjy cloud storage, but at the end of the day for cloud storage it is going to be on Azure, Amazon or Google one way or the other. I believe iCloud storage is not in some Apple data centres but in Amazon and Google data centres.
