I am at a point now having setting up my new business Gamma data that I can reflect on the structure of my nascent business. 

I am now at the stage where I have my first client, everything I need set up with HMRC, my basic business proposition formed in my head and the beginnings of my business and finacial processes in place.

Setting up one's own business allows one to think about what kind on business does one want to have, and in this blog to think about what is the business tech that will underpin my business.

I have intentionally set out to base my business around Open Source and Linux as much as possible. This is both becaus eof my long standing love for both these things, and because I have noticed in setting up a business the vast number of potentially monthly subscription services, ie. graphic design software, development software, book-keeping software, office software, website hosting, email hosting etc etc. 

These services are admirable in that they allow one to get a business up and running very quickly, but at the same time they all cost money. I may not know much about business, but I do know two things, sale and margins are key to financial success.

To this end, and should it be useful for others here is an outline of my business stack where I am intentionally building a stack around Open Source and Linux as much as I can. 

For my web-hosting I have chosen to use carrd.co which allow sone to create simple one-page websites. Because of the simplicity this ends costing USD$19 a year to host a website with your custom domain. This is less than what it costs per month on many other services. At this point in my business journey. I don't need anything more than a simple website.
- I have created mjy blog using Github pages, which is a free web hosting solution.

For my email, I have continued to use Proton mail, which I have used personally for a number of years, a monthly or yearly subscription is not a great deal of money.

For my book keeping, I am using GnuCash which is a free and open source accountancy package, and while it does look dated, it does more than I will ever need, and provide me with all the information I will need to send to my accountant.

The operating system I am using is Linux, Fedora is the distribution, I was using Arch Linux previously, but unfortunately I just don't have the time to use the terminal everytime I want to connect a new blue tooth device or change the volume.

I do dual-boot into windows as the Microsoft Office suite is unavoidable when working with clients, I could use it on the web in Linux, but it is easier to just submit to Windows when I need to.

My backup and storage solution is that I am running network attached storage on a drive connected to a raspberry pie. I use Syncthing to synch data between my storage and mjy laptop, this is then also synced onto Apple's iCloud to ensure I have data backed up offsite. I also have weekly and monthly backups taking place to mjy onsite and cloud storage. I am not completely happy using Apple for mjy cloud storage, but at the end of the day for cloud storage it is going to be on Azure, Amazon or Google one way or the other. I believe iCloud storage is not in some Apple data centres but in Amazon and Google data centres.

Now the most important piece of software I use is emacs with org-mode, which serves as my notes, todo and project management, development environment, and almost everything else. Emacs really is the centre-piece of minimising my need to subscribe to many subscription services to get my business up and running.
