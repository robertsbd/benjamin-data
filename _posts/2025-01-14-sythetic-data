In my Data and Analytics work on a large project with a client I have found our Data team in the position where we have done our work with the end users to understand the analytic outcomes needed, but we are running well ahead of the source data systems coming online.

The absence of data could be a blocker for the development of Reporting and Analytics outcomes. However by creating synthetic data we are able to advance our work building dimensional data models and reports that we can play back and refine with the end-users ahead of the go-live of the source systems.

What I have found is just how fast you can generate high quality synthetic data using Generative AI. Here we produce code with well developed and refined prompts that capture the transactional logic in the underlying source system. This can be done by a suitably knowledgable person in a couple of days.

Taking such an approach allows data teams to get ahead of a project, and in-addition work with business users to be that change agent for the project by familiarising them with a new data landscape.

It really is quite amazing. If anyone wants a chat about how this could work in your organisation or your project please do get in touch.
